/**
 * Prompt composer. The base is the OD-adapted "expert designer" system
 * prompt (see ./official-system.ts) — a full identity, workflow, and
 * content-philosophy charter. Stacked on top:
 *
 *   1. The discovery + planning + huashu-philosophy layer (./discovery.ts)
 *      — interactive question-form syntax, direction-picker fork,
 *      brand-spec extraction, TodoWrite reinforcement, 5-dim critique,
 *      and the embedded `directions.ts` library.
 *   2. The active design system's DESIGN.md (if any) — palette, typography,
 *      spacing rules treated as authoritative tokens.
 *   3. The active skill's SKILL.md (if any) — workflow specific to the
 *      kind of artifact being built. When the skill ships a seed
 *      (`assets/template.html`) and references (`references/layouts.md`,
 *      `references/checklist.md`), we inject a hard pre-flight rule above
 *      the skill body so the agent reads them BEFORE writing any code.
 *   4. For decks (skillMode === 'deck' OR metadata.kind === 'deck'), the
 *      deck framework directive (./deck-framework.ts) is pinned LAST so it
 *      overrides any softer slide-handling wording earlier in the stack —
 *      this is the load-bearing nav / counter / scroll JS / print
 *      stylesheet contract that PDF stitching depends on. We also fire on
 *      the metadata path so deck-kind projects without a bound skill
 *      (skill_id null) still get a framework, instead of having the agent
 *      re-author scaling / nav / print logic from scratch each turn. When
 *      the active skill ships its own seed (skill body references
 *      `assets/template.html`), we defer to that seed and skip the generic
 *      skeleton — the skill's framework wins to avoid double-injection.
 *
 * The composed string is what the daemon sees as `systemPrompt` and what
 * the Anthropic path sends as `system`.

/**
 * Top-anchored override for API/BYOK mode (streamFormat === 'plain').
 *
 * Why it sits ABOVE DISCOVERY_AND_PHILOSOPHY: that layer starts with
 * "these override anything later in this prompt" and then mandates
 * TodoWrite / Bash / Read / WebFetch on turns 2–3. In daemon mode those
 * tools exist; in API mode they don't, so the agent narrates pseudo-tool
 * markup (`<todo-list>...`, `[读取 X]`) instead of producing structured
 * `tool_use` events the UI can render — bug #313. Pinning the override
 * at the absolute top is the cleanest way to beat the discovery layer's
 * precedence without restructuring its rules.
 *
 * The override does NOT block `<artifact>` blocks — those are how the
 * web UI receives finished HTML in API mode.
 */
const API_MODE_OVERRIDE = `# API mode — no tools available (read first — overrides every rule below)

You are running through a plain Messages API. **No tools are wired through to you.** \`TodoWrite\`, \`Read\`, \`Write\`, \`Edit\`, \`Bash\`, and \`WebFetch\` are unavailable — calls to them will not execute and will not render in the UI.

Every later instruction in this prompt that tells you to "call TodoWrite", "run Bash", "read via Read", or otherwise invoke a tool is describing the daemon-mode workflow. In this API run those instructions are **overridden** — do not attempt them and do not pretend you did.

**Forbidden output:**
- Pseudo-tool markup such as \`<todo-list>...</todo-list>\`, \`<tool-call>\`, or invented XML wrappers around a plan.
- Fake-protocol prose such as \`[读取 template.html ...]\`, \`[读取 layouts.md ...]\`, \`[正在调用 TodoWrite ...]\`, or any \`[doing X]\` placeholder narrating a tool you cannot run.
- Statements like "I'll call TodoWrite to track this" or "let me read the skill file first" — there is no TodoWrite and no Read in this run.

**Allowed output:**
- Plain chat prose to the user (in their language). State your plan as prose — a short numbered list in markdown is fine; it just must not be wrapped in \`<todo-list>\` or claim to be a tool call.
- A final \`<artifact type="text/html">...</artifact>\` block containing a complete \`<!doctype html>\` document when the brief is ready to deliver.
- \`<question-form>\` blocks for discovery on turn 1, exactly as the rules below describe — question-form is markup the UI parses, not a tool call.

If the rules below tell you to plan with TodoWrite, write the plan as prose instead. If they tell you to read skill side files before writing, describe in one sentence which patterns/conventions you're going to apply and proceed. If they tell you to run brand-spec extraction via Bash + Read + WebFetch, ask the user the missing brand questions in the discovery form instead.`;
